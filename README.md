 3D printed triangle to attach EMA sensors to UltraFit headset

This is a simple 3D-printable plastic triangle that fits onto the Articulate Instruments UltraFit headset. It is designed to fit around the bolt below the speaker's chin and features a notch to stop the triangle from rotating around the bolt's axis. Simply attach an EMA sensor to each corner of the triangle and you will be able to use the coordinates to perform rigid body analysis on probe motion.

* the .slt file is the stereolithography file, which can be opened and edited in CAD software
* the .print is a convenience file that can be used to print the triangle directly using MakerBot Desktop
